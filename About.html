                <p class="about-description">I believe one of the 2 most important quality I posses is the ability to to work hard and to stay positive. I have tried my very best to always take those 2 qualities and bring it to all places of employment. I try my best to work hard because it's always been a part of me, I always believed that if you don't put your 100% into what you're doing then there is no reason to do it. I have taken this attitude toward work every where I have gone.</p>

                <h3 class="about-description-title">Sparks of Curiosity</h3>
                <p class="about-description">During COVID I become very interested in software. I started to re-learn C++ and I mainly did it as a hobby. I was already introduced to C++ in highschool when our robotics team decided to build our own controls system for our robot vs using the one that came with the hardware. After University, I started to work for a software company called Building Stack were I was hired because of my knowledge with software development as well as my many years of experience with customer service, I become the technical support staff of that organization. 
                    Our highest priority was always dealing with bugs. This resulted in me working very closely with the QA team, because I had working knowledge with C++; it made it very easy for me to find the issue at hand, then convey the issue to the QA team in a way that was easy to understand.</p>

                <h3 class="about-description-title">My Journey Begins</h3>    
                <p class="about-description">For a better part of a year I started to realize that I become more and more interested in the development side of work rather then the customer service side. I then made a major decision in my life and decided that I would like to pursue a career in Software development. I begin with going through a non-profit coding school called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>. They give out free certificates for individuals who pass their online tests. 
                    I have everything I need to know to start coding and am currently go through the major JS libraries that are present in software industries (React, Redux, Angulare, etc). I am also familiarizing my self with with all things network, and server based operations and optimization. For a updated list of all the languages and libraries I am familiar with, please check out my LinkedIn profile (link is found in the Contact page).</p>

                <h3 class="about-description-title">Free Time</h3>
                <p class="about-description">On my free time I build and develop things. One of my most recent projects was to make a program a macro keyboard to hold multiple macros of my choosing, it is currently built with cheap parts (3d-Printed a model of my own design and a microcontroller I bought). I am currently communicating with some Chinese manufactures on developing a mass market product made of quality materials (aluminum) as well a more permanent PCB design. 
                    One of my long term goals is to work on developing and implementing a solar array for my home. I do have a couple of other ideas that are still in the infancy stages but this is what I do for fun on my free time.</p>

                <h3 class="about-description-title">Goals</h3>
                <p class="about-description">I have always oriented my career goals towards what I would like to learn/know how to do. I believe my long term goal is to either work in the cutting edge of software engineering (AI & Machine Learning) as well as getting involved with network security. I do understand that they are very big topics and require a lot of knowledge and experience to get to that point. I am hoping to get to that point working with your organization to reach your own goals as well as mine.
