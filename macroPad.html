    <h3>MacroPad</h3>
    <p>This perticulare porject was designed to help productivity when navigating your PC. When developing the code as well as the orginal 3d models, it had to have minimilistic view as well as easy upgradable if need be. The following image is what was the result that design mind set.</p>
    <img src="" class="MacroImg" alt="MacroPad3DModel" />
    <p>I am currently working with some chines CNC manufactures to reproduce this pertuculare case for mass production and hopfully have product by 2023</p>
    <p>The brains of this product is run on a arduino framework (C++). The current code is designed so that you can always replace the existing macros and also works with 3rd party remaping software. I am also communicating with JLCPCB to stream line the board processes as well as make it cheaper for purchase.</p>
    <p class="3dProjectFooter">Please note that all 3d models are designed in Fusion360.</p>
