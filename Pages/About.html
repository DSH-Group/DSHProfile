        <h2 class="sectionTitle">About Me</h1>
            <p class="description">I believe one of the 2 most important quality I posses is the ability to to work hard and to stay positive. I have tried my very best to always take those 2 qualities and bring it to all places of employment. I try my best to work hard because it's always been a part of me, I always believed that if you don't put your 100% into what you're doing then there is no reason to do it. I have taken this attitude toward work every where I have gone.</p>

            <p class="description">During COVID I become very interested in software. I started to learn C++ and I mainly did it as a hobby. After University, I started to work for a software company called Building Stack were I was hired because of my knowledge with software development as well as my many years of experience with customer service, I become the technical support staff of that organization. 
                Our highest priority was always dealing with bugs. This resulted in me working very closely with the QA team, because I had working knowledge with C++; it made it very easy for me to find the issue at hand, then convey the issue to the QA team in a way that was easy to understand.</p>
            
            <p class="description">For a better part of a year I started to realize that I become more and more interested in the development side of work rather then the customer service side. I then made a major decision in my life and decided that I would like to pursue a career in Software development. I begin with going through a non-profit coding school called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>. They give out free certificates for individuals who pass their online tests. 
                I have everything I need to know to start coding and am currently go through the major JS libraries that are present in software industries (React, Redux, Angulare, etc). I am also familiarizing my self with with all things network, and server based optimization. For a updated list of all the languages and libraries I am familiar with, please check out my LinkedIn profile (link is found in the Contact page).</p>
            
            <p class="description">I have always oriented my goals towards what I would like to learn/know how to do. I believe my long term goal is to either work in the cutting edge of software engineering (AI & Machine Learning) as well as getting involved with network security. I do understand that they are very big topics and require a lot of knowledge and experience to get to that point. I am hoping to get to that point working with your organization to reach your own goals as well as mine.
                If you have any further questions or if you would like references feel free to email me anytime. I am hoping to hear from you soon!</p>
            
            <p class="description">On my free time I build and develop things. One of my most recent projects was to make a program a macro keyboard to hold multiple macros of my choosing, it is currently built with cheap parts (3d-Printed a model of my own design and a microcontroller I bought). I am currently communicating with some Chinese manufactures on developing a mass market product made of quality materials (aluminum) as well a more permanent PCB design. 
                One of my long term goals is to work on developing and implementing a solar array for my home. I do have a couple of other ideas that are still in the infancy stages but this is what I do for fun on my free time.</p>
